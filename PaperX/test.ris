AB  - Through our art project, Metaphone, we explored a particular form of
aesthetics referred to in the arts tradition as machine aesthetics. The
Metaphone machine collects the participant's bio-data, Galvanic Skin Response
(GSR) and Heart Rate (HR), creating a process of movement, painting and sound.
The machine behaves in machine-like, aesthetically evocative ways: a shaft on
two large wheels rotates on the floor, carrying paint that is dripped onto a
large sheet of aquarelle paper on the floor according to bio-sensor data. A
soundscape rhythmically follows the bio-sensor data, but also has its own
machine-like sounds. Six commentators were invited to interact with the
machine. They reported a strangely relaxing atmosphere induced by the machine.
Based on these experiences we discuss how different art styles can help to
describe aesthetics in interaction design generally, and how machine aesthetics
in particular can be used to create interesting, sustained, stylistically
coherent interactions.

AB  - Website aesthetics have been recognized as an influential moderator of
people's behavior and perception. However, what users perceive as "good design"
is subject to individual preferences, questioning the feasibility of universal
design guidelines. To better understand how people's visual preferences differ,
we collected 2.4 million ratings of the visual appeal of websites from nearly
40 thousand participants of diverse backgrounds. We address several gaps in the
knowledge about design preferences of previously understudied groups. Among
other findings, our results show that the level of colorfulness and visual
complexity at which visual appeal is highest strongly varies: Females, for
example, liked colorful websites more than males. A high education level
generally lowers this preference for colorfulness. Russians preferred a lower
visual complexity, and Macedonians liked highly colorful designs more than any
other country in our dataset. We contribute a computational model and estimates
of peak appeal that can be used to support rapid evaluations of website design
prototypes for specific target groups.

AB  - An experimental study examined whether the effects of aesthetic appeal on
usability test outcomes are moderated by usage domain. The aesthetic appeal of
a cell phone was experimentally manipulated in both home- and work-based usage
domains. The two usage domains were modeled in a usability laboratory. 60
participants completed a series of typical cell phone user tasks. Dependent
measures such as performance, perceived usability, and emotion were taken. The
results showed that aesthetic appeal had a positive effect on perceived
usability but a negative effect on performance. The effects of aesthetic appeal
on usability test outcomes were not moderated by usage domain. The results of
this study imply that it may be sufficient to test dual-domain products in only
one of their usage domains.
